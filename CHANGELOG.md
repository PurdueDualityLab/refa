# Changelog

## 0.3.0 (TBD)

### Breaking changes

- New `JS.Parser` API.
- Removed `MutSimple` interface.

### Added

- `CharSet#size` returns the number of characters in the set.
- `NFA#prefixes()` will change the NFA such that it accepts all prefixes of itself.
- New `ReadonlyNFA` interface.
- New `FAIterator` interface as an abstraction over different FA representations. This is now the basis for virtually all FA operations that don't change the underlying data structure.
- New `NoParent` and `NoSource` interface for AST nodes.

### Changed

- Better `Flags` interface for JS functions.
- Some minor improvements.

### Fixed

- The prefix and suffix optimizations of the NFA construction didn't check the equivalence of states correctly.


## 0.2.2 (2020-05-04)

### Fixed

- Added a `prepublish` script to actually publish changes.


## 0.2.1 (2020-05-04)

### Fixed

- Calling `CharSet#isSubsetOf` caused a stack overflow because of infinite recursion.


## 0.2.0 (2020-05-03)

### Breaking changes

- New `CharSet` API. This renames some of `has*` methods, to instead use names based on set relations.
- `NFA#concat` is now called `append`.
- `NodeList#final` is now called `finals` for both DFA and NFA nodes lists.
- `NFANode#in` and `NFANode#out` are now of type `ReadonlyMap` instead of `Map`.

### Added

- New options for `NFA.fromRegex` to disable assertions instead of throwing an error and to simplify quantifiers with a huge maximum.
- New `NFA#prepend` method.
- Added changelog.

### Changed

- `CharSet#toString` now uses a simple hexadecimal format.

### Fixed

- `NFA#append` modified the given NFA.


## 0.1.1 (2020-04-05)

### Fixed

- Fixed repository link in `package.json`.
