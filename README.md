# Regular Expressions and Finite Automata (refa)

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/RunDevelopment/refa/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/RunDevelopment/refa/actions)

A library for finite automata (FA) and regular expressions (RE) in the context of Javascript RegExp.


## About

This is a general library for [DFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton), [NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton), and REs of [formal regular languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_of_regular_languages).

It also supports additional methods to easily convert from JS RegExp to the internal RE ast and vice versa.

__At this point in time, the library is still in development and partially incomplete!__
